# Cellular Automata Projects

### Conway's Game of Life
`gameoflife.py` is my attempt at a Game of Life simulation. Uses Pygame, Numpy and RE.
Includes controls to move around and zoom, change speed, or toggle color-mode.
I've also made several alternative versions, `life-infdict.py` uses a dictionary so
gliders and such can travel outward "forever". Other versions in 'old' folder.

### Maze-like generation rule
`mazegen.py` is a version of life, with additional rules which result in maze-like patterns.
Rules: B3/S12345 (or B3/S1234 for mazectric rules)
